Godot Engine does a terrific job of organizing built-in nodes and allowing you to create new ones or replace existing ones. However, it does not do quite as well for scripted types or custom types (which are also scripted). Likewise, it doesn't provide a convenient overview of the relationships between your project's various scenes. It also is more cumbersome than it should be to edit resource files in your projects. This plugin seeks to remedy those problems.

With this plugin, you will be able to...

- Quickly locate existing scenes, scripts, and resources with filenames that match custom regex filters.
- Visually see scene/script/resource relationships.
- Open any scene/script/resource in the dock.
- Instance scenes and nodes with scripts into the scene tree.
- Extend new scenes and scripts from the dock.
- Change nodes to use or extend a script in the dock.
- Add children that use or extend a script in the dock.
- Create and edit new resources easily from the dock.
- Filter by in-engine class type (scenes are filtered based on the root node).

## Installation

Drop the `godot_inheritance_dock` folder in an `addons` folder in your project.
